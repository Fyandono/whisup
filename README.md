📢 Whisup

Whisup is a lightweight, fun, and expressive social micro-posting app designed especially for Gen Z.
Post your thoughts ("whisps"), react with emojis, and connect through quick, low-pressure interactions.
Think of it as your digital whisper space — a safe place to share, react, and relate.

✨ Features
Post Whisps – Share short messages, thoughts, or feelings instantly.

Pixel Avatars – Unique and randomly generated avatars for a fun identity.

Emoji Reactions – Express yourself with multiple emoji types (love, laugh, surprise, relate, and more).

Dynamic Counts – Reactions update in real-time without refreshing the whole feed.

Highlight Tags – Distinguish whisps with colorful label chips.

Shimmer Loading – Smooth skeleton loading states for better UX.

Comment & React – Interact through quick emoji taps or replies.

💬 Inspiration
Whisup was built to capture quick emotions and thoughts without the pressure of traditional social media.
Fast. Fun. Freeing.

If you want, I can also make a playful Gen Z–style version of this README that matches the app’s fun branding. That one would be more punchy, colorful, and emoji-heavy.
